## Luhur Uluwatu Temple

The Luhur Uluwatu temple is located in the south of the island on a 75-meter-high cliff, it was built to ward off evil spirits in the 10th century, it stands out for the large number of tourists who go to the temple to see the wonderful sunset in the Indian Ocean. This site is close to beaches that are worth visiting such as Balangan, Bingin or Padang Padang. One recommendation is that you have to be careful with the monkeys and keep your glasses or small objects well, because they are capable of taking them and running away. Several places provide food for the monkey to drop the objects, in case of theft it is advisable to go to these specific places.

## Ubud

Ubud is a city that is located in the central part of the island, so it is the perfect place to stay and have the points of interest closer. But there are also many things to see in Ubud and it is able to mix the modern with the traditional. The most important places to visit in this city are the temples, the market, the Monkey Forest, the hiking trails that are found through the rice fields, the massage and yoga centers, the traditional houses, the craft centers, the art galleries and enjoy its cuisine in its restaurants and cafes.

## Rice terraces

Bali's main crop is rice, so rice terraces are scattered all over the island. Although it is true that there are very beautiful rice fields around Ubud, we also recommend you visit the Tegallalang and Jatiluwih rice fields, which we consider to be the most beautiful, with an intense green, full of water and surrounded by a great environment.

## Pura Tanah Lot

Tanah Lot is one of the best temples in Bali, built in the middle of the sea on a rocky islet where you can see the sunset or sunrise with the temple, the ocean in the background and the waves breaking on the rocks, that's all a show. You can see this Hindu temple dedicated to the god of the sea up close at low tide by accessing it from the beach, since you cannot visit its interior, but it is a unique experience to complement sunrise or sunset.

## Volcanoes

Bali is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic and volcanic activity. The Batur volcano is the highest on the island and measures 1717 meters, being the best known and although its last eruption was in 1964, it is still active. You can climb the crater in an excursion that ranges between 2 and 3 hours, but if you take it easy it is accessible to all travelers. Once at the top you will have excellent panoramic views of Lake Batur, the valley and the small plumes that rise from the caldera of the volcano.

The other recommended volcano to visit is El Batran, which has a large caldera with several lakes and there is the Pura Ulun Danu Batran, one of the most beautiful temples in Bali. The last volcano on the list is Agung, sacred to Hindus and of great importance to the Balinese, since they consider it a replica of Mount Meru.

Penataran Agung is its most outstanding temple with seven levels of terraces that symbolize the layers of the universe, but only the followers of its religion can climb the grand staircase.

## Waterfalls
