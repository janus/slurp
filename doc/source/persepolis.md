The full glory of the great Persian Empire was Persepolis a massive palace
complex which was the ceremonial center of the ancient empire.

been efforts to rebuild and restore some of the amazing columns, buildings,
carved reliefs and even the original staircase built by Darius. Giant carved
bearded bull like men stand guard flanked alongside an entryway.

plains of Marvdasht which are surrounded by the southern Zagros mountains of
Iran.
